Unit testing is a self-explanatory word if one understands what is meant by Unit. A unit is the smallest possible piece of code that can be logically isolated from the system. This means that any piece of code that can take inputs, perform a task, and generate output even when independent from the entire system or solution, can be termed as a Unit. Testing this piece of code to generate expected output on a given set of inputs is called Unit Testing.
